    "description": "Amazon GameLift Service  Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who\nneed a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Use\nAmazon GameLift for these tasks: (1) set up computing resources and deploy your\ngame servers, (2) run game sessions and get players into games, (3)\nautomatically scale your resources to meet player demand and manage costs, and\n(4) track in-depth metrics on game server performance and player usage.\n\nThe Amazon GameLift service API includes two important function sets:\n\n *   Manage game sessions and player access -- Retrieve information on available\n   game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join a game\n   session.\n   \n   \n *   Configure and manage game server resources -- Manage builds, fleets, queues,\n   and aliases; set auto-scaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.\n   \n   \n\nThis reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift.\nYou can use the API functionality with these tools: \n\n *  The Amazon Web Services software development kit (AWS SDK\n   [http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk]) is available in multiple languages\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-supported.html#gamelift-supported-clients] \n   including C++ and C#. Use the SDK to access the API programmatically from an\n   application, such as a game client.\n   \n   \n *  The AWS command-line interface\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/] (CLI) tool is primarily\n   useful for handling administrative actions, such as setting up and managing\n   Amazon GameLift settings and resources. You can use the AWS CLI to manage all\n   of your AWS services.\n   \n   \n *  The AWS Management Console [https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/home] for\n   Amazon GameLift provides a web interface to manage your Amazon GameLift\n   settings and resources. The console includes a dashboard for tracking key\n   resources, including builds and fleets, and displays usage and performance\n   metrics for your games as customizable graphs.\n   \n   \n *  Amazon GameLift Local is a tool for testing your game's integration with\n   Amazon GameLift before deploying it on the service. This tools supports a\n   subset of key API actions, which can be called from either the AWS CLI or\n   programmatically.
